**Minimum Requirements**
The game is best experienced on PC having BlueJ, IntelliJ or a similar Java IDE.

**Steps to Start the Game (for BlueJ)**
- Create a new class. Then copy and paste the source code.  
- Right click on the program file in BlueJ's main window, and then,
- Left click on the void main(String[]args) tab.
- A window will pop up: Left click on OK to run the program. The game will start in BlueJ's "terminal" window.

OR, you can also use the IDE's inbuilt VCS cloning feature to directly import the files. 

**In-game Controls**
Since its a text based game, you won't require arrow keys to control. Instead, you control your in-game character via a set of instructions that  appear on screen. Please remember, some commands might be case sensitive and can result in an error if not entered in the correct case.
